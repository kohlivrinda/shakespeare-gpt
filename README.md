# shakespeare-gpt
A Generatively Pretrained Transformer that generates Shakespeare-eque quotes, based on the demonstration by Andrej Karpathy.

This project was created to accomplish the following goals:
1. Gain a deeper understanding of the transformer architecture
2. Implement multi-headed attention.
3. Get insight into the power of transformers over standard NLP techniques.

There are a bunch of things pertaining to this project that I would like to experiment with in future.
- Currently the model works on word-level, thus the sentences generated may appear nonsensical. The next thing for me is to explore more advanced tokenization methods such as WordPiece tokenizer.
- I also wish to train this model on different datasets to see how it performs.
